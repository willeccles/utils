# Will Eccles' Utils

This is a collection of small utility programs I have written to make my daily
life easier. You may or may not find any of them useful. This repository is
likely a huge mess, but that is irrelevant.

# Building

Use GNU Make or something compatible. Otherwise, use a compiler manually for any
particular program. Use `make install' to install the programs. They will be
placed in $DESTDIR/$PREFIX/bin (default is /usr/local/bin).

# Usage

Run a program without any arguments for details.

# Programs

At this time, the following programs are included in this repository:
 - hex2float: converts a 32-bit hex value to a 32-bit float
 - symgrab:   reads a symbol from an object file in various formats
